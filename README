tomcatpolicyprotocol is a Tomcat protocol handler that serves a Flash socket policy file which is needed when you want to establish a socket connection with Flash to your tomcat server in a cross domain conext.

When you use the http/https library for AS3 (http://github.com/gabriel/as3httpclient/tree/master) that uses sockets connections to connect to the server, this little tomcat extension helps you to fullfill the security requirements of the new Flash players (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/socket_policy_files.html)

Configruation:
This is a Forked from https://github.com/mohlendo/tomcatpolicyprotocol and ported to work with Tomcat 8. 
Just copy the socket-policy-server-1.1.jar, created by the maven build, to the tomcat lib folder.
Add the following connector to the list of connectors in the server.xml:

  <Connector protocol="com.cinergix.flash.SocketPolicyProtocolHandler"/>

This connector now serves a default socket policy file on port 843.
If you want a different port you can change it like this:
  <Connector port="8111" protocol="com.cinergix.flash.SocketPolicyProtocolHandler"/>

Default policy file is:

  <cross-domain-policy>
  	<site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies="master-only"/>
  	<allow-access-from domain="*" to-ports="*" />
  </cross-domain-policy>
  
 You can also change the default policy file by specifying the absolute path to it:
  <Connector port="8111" policyFile="/policy.xml" protocol="com.cinergix.flash.SocketPolicyProtocolHandler"/>

By default it uses one acceptor threads and 5 worker threads.
If you want to change the maximum number of worker thread then you can do it as follows
	<Connector maxThreadPoolSize="10" protocol="com.cinergix.flash.SocketPolicyProtocolHandler"/>
	
Keep alive time by default 60 seconds is set to the connector, you can change it like this,
	<Connector keepAliveTime="30" protocol="com.cinergix.flash.SocketPolicyProtocolHandler"/>
